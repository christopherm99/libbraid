libbraid -- C99 library for coroutines.

WHAT

  libbraid is heavily inspired by higan's libco and Russ Cox's libtask. 

  The goal is to provide the non-blocking IO features of libtask, while keeping
  the simplicity of libco. Additionally, libbraid should be highly portable,
  just by writing a bit of assembly for saving and restoring contexts (and some
  glue in `cordcreate`).

TERMINOLOGY

   * braid: a set of cooperatively scheduled cords.
   * cord: a coroutine.
   * context: the state of a cord, that is, its callee-saved registers.
